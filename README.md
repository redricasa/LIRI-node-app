## Link to Deployed Application: 
## Overview: 
LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies. LIRI node app is a Command Line Interface(CLI) application which takes in three arguments (process.argv). You'd type in `node` then one of these commands:
- `concert-this` then a concert name you're interested in, 
- `spotify-this-song` to get details on a song from Spotify's API,
- `movie-this` to get OMDB's response on a particular movie, 
- `do-what-it-says` to get a random response from one of the three commands above!
